# Memory-Bank Documentation Hub

Welcome to the **Memory-Bank** &mdash; the living knowledge base for the Analyst Augmentation Agent project (`anal-ist1`).  
This folder centralises **architecture diagrams, design notes, research, hand-off logs and operational status records** so that every contributor can quickly find the “why” behind the code.

## ✍️ Contributing to Documentation

1. **Keep it source-controlled.** Always place docs in this folder so they version with code.  
2. **Prefer Markdown.** Use headings and tables for readability.  
3. **Timestamp logs.** Name hand-off files `session-handoff-YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`.  
4. **Cross-link generously.** Link code files with the `@` mention in Factory or relative paths.  
5. **Review like code.** Submit a PR; reviewers look for clarity, accuracy and redundancy removal.
